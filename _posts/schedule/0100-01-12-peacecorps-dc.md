Peace Corps' Office of Innovation is hosting a mapping party for the Peace Corps Community. We're bringing together Returned Peace Corps Volunteers, staff and friends of Peace Corps to actively map for current Peace Corps field projects. This event is open to the public and virtual participants. Beginners welcome! Please register [here](https://peacecorpsosmgeoweek.eventbrite.com).
