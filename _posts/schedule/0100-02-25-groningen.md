A Missing Maps Event will be held in Groningen on the 10th of November, in collaboration with the Netherlands Red Cross, American Red Cross, OpenStreetMap Foundation, Geon B.V. and University of Groningen.

Join us for a pizza and help the Red Cross by mapping areas that don't have maps yet. Experience is not necessary! 

Bring your own laptop and â‚¬5,- cash and we will organize the rest!
