Mapbox will be hosting an OSM community mapping party to celebrate OpenStreetMap Geography Awareness Week on November 15, 2015 at their office in Bengaluru, India. Join us to hangout with mappers from the local OpenStreetMap community, learn new tools, hack on your ideas or try completing the map of the neighborhood with a field survey.

Details and RSVP on the [OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/India/Events/Bengaluru_Mapping_Party_3_-_osmgeoweek).
