The university of Kelaniya has organized a mapathon for Wednesday, November 18th. Students will help to map the area around their university and flood prone areas to the north in the Atanugal Oya river basin. Data from the latter will be used to model flood impacts and plan for flood reduction measures by the World Bank and the Sri Lankan government. Trainers from the World Bank and the Sri Lankan government will be on hand to answer questions and provide advice to the students
