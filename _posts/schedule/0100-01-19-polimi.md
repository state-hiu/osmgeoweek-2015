The GEOlab (Geomatics and Earth Observation laboratory) of Politecnico di Milano is hosting this mapathon in the frame of the OpenStreetMap Geography Awareness Week. During the mapathon in Milan the staff of GEOlab will introduce the OSM project and train the participants on how to get started on mapping. The focus will be placed on geographical areas and mapping tasks proposed by the HOT and the Missing Maps project. During the mapathon two senior members of HOT will be reached through a Skype call.
