In relation to the Geography Awareness Week 2015, the students from University of Gothenburg Applied IT department together with SKIP (The Association for Informatics and Programming) is hosting a short Mapathon at University of Gothenburg Campus Lindholmen for students with various professional backgrounds (from programming and IT to Geography and Environmental Sciences). The event is free, but you need to bring a laptop and a mouse as it will be more comfortable for you to work. You can create an account at www.openstreetmap.org before the event or you can do it together with others during an event and you will be guided through the short tutorials. No mapping, programming or development experience is needed. Just come and learn!
