Full info and [RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/Maptime-Boulder/events/226410045/) 
This meeting we'll celebrate GIS Day by learning humanitarian mapping using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform. OSM is a global volunteer-led effort to produce a free and open map of the world. In recent years it has been used to create maps in support a number of major disaster response efforts. We will be mapping in support of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT), a non-profit organization that "applies the principles of open source and open data sharing for humanitarian response and economic development." This event is being sponsored by the Department of Geography at CU Boulder. Beginners and experts alike are welcome. Please bring a laptop
