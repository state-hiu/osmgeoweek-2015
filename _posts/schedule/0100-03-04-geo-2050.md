[Geography 2050](http://www.geography2050.org/) is the fall symposium of the American Geographical Society. The theme is "Exploring Our Future in an Urbanized World".

Mikel Maron will be speaking in the "Big Cities == Big Data" session, talking about OpenStreetMap communities, Open Mapping and Government, and highlighting all the amazing mapping happening during OSMGeoWeek. We'll be sharing the progress of OSMGeoWeek mapping throughout the conference.
