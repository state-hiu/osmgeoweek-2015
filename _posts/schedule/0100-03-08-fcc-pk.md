Description: MapGive Pakistan community is organizing a mapathon at Forman Christian College (FCC) in Lahore, Pakistan. The mapathon is hosted in celebration of OpenStreetMaps Geo Awareness Week. The mapathon will help the students learn the skill of digital mapping and how to map during a disaster. The training will broadly cover the topics like what is MapGive, what is OSM and HOT, how OSM works, how to map in OSM, and ultimately how to become a global digital humanitarian. Mappers will also map a few select disaster hit areas around the globe. These students will then become the members of the growing MapGive Pakistan community. The session will be organized from 10am to 12:30pm on Wednesday, November 18, 2015 at FCC.
