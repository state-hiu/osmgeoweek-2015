[ATI-KOS](www.ati-kos.com) in collaboration with [BONEVET Makerspace](www.bonevet.org) will celebrate Geography Awareness Week 2015 with a Mapathon on 17 November 2015 1:00 - 5:00pm (CET) at BONEVET premises in Gjakova, Kosovo.

Our goal is to help 10-18 years old pupils to:

·         Get more information about Geographic Information System (GIS),

·         Use free and open source tools for GIS and

·         In the end it we’ll be Mapathon using OpenStreetMap and Humanitarian Mapping HotOSM.
