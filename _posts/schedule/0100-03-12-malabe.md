The Sri Lankan Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) has organized a Mapathon for Thursday, November 19th. Students will help to map the area around their university.  They will be introduced to mapping flood prone areas to the north in the Attanagalu Oya river basin also. Data from the latter will be used to model flood impacts and plan for flood reduction measures by the World Bank and the Sri Lankan government. Trainers from the World Bank will be on hand to answer questions and provide advice to the students.
