We are organising a Mapping Pub Crawl using Field Papers on Friday the 20th of November, starting at 8PM. Every participant will get a printed atlas from Field Papers (Zagreb area) and visit 4 pubs using different routes and taking notes on the atlas, and at the end of the night atlantes will be collected by the organisers and then uploaded on Field Papers.
