In celebration of OSM GeoWeek, 8th graders at Ho-Ho-Kus Middle School will be participating in a Mapathon on Tuesday, November 17. Some of our 8th grade students are working with a Peace Corps volunteer in Senegal. Our map data will be used by the local health system to track incidence of malaria and to improve services for people living with HIV in the city.
