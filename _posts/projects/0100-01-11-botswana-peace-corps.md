UNAIDS estimates that 25% of Botswanian adults age 15-49 are living with HIV. Francistown is the second largest city in Botswana and suffers one of the highest rates of HIV in Botswana due to the fact that it is a stopover for many travelers, both domestic and foreign. It can be difficult to reach the entirety of Francistown's population -- over 100,000 -- with HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs. 

The District AIDS Office, the District Health Management Team and the Peace Corps Botswana public health program plan to map the entirety of Francistown in OpenStreetMap. Upon completion of the map these organizations will be able to better analyze areas with high rates of HIV/AIDS. The Health Management team also plans to use OSM and geospatial data to improve operations of its tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infection clinics.

#How to Contribute

[Please join us](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1099) in providing a base map of Francistown to the District AIDS Office, the District Health Management Team and the Peace Corps public health program in Botswana. We need help remotely digitizing satellite imagery of roads and buildings; once complete, the field team will use the [OpenStreetMap platform](http://openstreetmap.org/) and [Field Papers](http://fieldpapers.org/) to verify the remote mapping and add detailed local knowledge.

If you are new to humanitarian mapping and editing through the OpenStreetMap platform, we highly recommend MapGiveâ€™s (an initiative of the U.S. State Department) [video tutorials](http://www.mapgive.state.gov/).
