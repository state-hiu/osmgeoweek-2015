[The Open Data for Resilience project](www.gfdrr.org/opendri) will power flood reduction measures in the Atanagalu Oya river basin with OpenStreetMap data. The river basin regularly floods, destroying crops, homes and the overall livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people. Universities and responsible government ministries will be trained in using and adding to the OpenStreetMap data collected so it can be reused for other government functions as well (urban planning, etc.). 

The project is the second phase in the development of a model for using open data that can be applied elsewhere in Sri Lanka (the first being in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka). The project is a collaborative effort between Sri Lanka's Disaster Management Center and the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR). 

Contributors will focus on the Atanagalu [Oya river basin project](https://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1280)
