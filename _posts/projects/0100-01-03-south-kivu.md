The Democratic Republic of Congo is a priority country for the Missing Maps project. South Kivu is a province of DRC that, for decades, has faced unceasing humanitarian crises. With constantly changing conflicts, seasonal disease epidemics and a population in constant flux, many international NGOs have permanent presences here.

There is no freely available mapping data available for the province, aside from that which has been already generously contributed by the HOT community in response to very specific crises. The Missing Maps has launched the Map South Kivu project to map the entire province, both remotely and through local community mapping.

The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.

Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping.
