Lubumbashi has been partially mapped at the request of MSF to help the organisation respond to the frequent disease outbreaks that hit the city. Missing Maps / HOT and the OSM lubumbashi group have completed the field mapping, so that MSF can use the data in outbreak surveillance and response. To conduct effective epidemiology, building level data is needed, and while Lubumbashi is very well mapped, a lot of neighbourhoods are lacking in this area. 

Please help us complete the tracing, so that the data can be used in the coming weeks!

The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur.
